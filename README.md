# Tencent Cloud DNS ACME webhook

This is a Webhook implementation used by Cert Manager in conjunction with Tencent Cloud DNS.

For more detailed information about webhook, please refer to the certificate manager documentation: https://certificate manager.io/docs/concepts/webhook/


### Running the test suite

All DNS providers **must** run the DNS01 provider conformance testing suite,
else they will have undetermined behaviour when used with cert-manager.

**It is essential that you configure and run the test suite when creating a
DNS01 webhook.**

An example Go test file has been provided in [main_test.go](https://github.com/cert-manager/webhook-example/blob/master/main_test.go).

You can run the test suite with:

```bash
$ TEST_ZONE_NAME=example.com. make test
```

The example file has a number of areas you must fill in and replace with your
own options in order for tests to pass.
